# Apple Leaf Disease Detection  
Detect diseases in apple-leaves using deep learning (PyTorch + Streamlit).  
This project is adapted from the repository [Poojareddy16/AppleLeaf_Disease_Detection](https://github.com/Poojareddy16/AppleLeaf_Disease_Detection).

## ðŸš€ Project Overview  
This repository provides an end-to-end solution to classify diseases in apple leaves using images. A trained PyTorch model is loaded in a Streamlit web application for easy testing.  
Key features:  
- Pretrained model (`best_model.pth`) for inference.  
- Simple web UI via Streamlit to upload leaf images and get disease predictions + confidence chart.  
- Modular code: dataset handling, model architecture, inference logic, web UI.  
- Useful for agricultural monitoring, early disease detection, and smart farming applications.
